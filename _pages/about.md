<h1> Who are the JEDIs</h1>
The JEDIs are early career scientists working on Drosophila melanogaster in Europe and having recently established their independent research group. 

<h1> Can I become a JEDI?</h1>
You donâ€™t become a JEDI. You are born JEDI. Just kidding. 
If you run your own laboratory and call yourself a fly person you are welcome to join. The club is open to researchers who are at early stages of their independent careers, possibly in a pre-tenure phase. 

<!--rite your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
